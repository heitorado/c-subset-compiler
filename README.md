# C Subset Compiler
This is my repo for store and track progress on the college project for the Compilers course on the second semester of 2020. Due to the pandemics the semester is of extraordinary character and it was called "2020.3".

The project consists on building a compiler for a subset of the C language. ANTLR is being used for parser generation.

# Running
Instructions to run each part of the project are contained on their respective folders.

# Copyright, disclaimers, and other stuff
- I, obviously, did not develop the .jar package of the ANTLR software provided in this repo. It was a copy provided for developing this project. Refer to the [official ANTLR website](https://www.antlr.org/) for the latest version and more info, etc.
- The makefile inside the /1_antl_grammar/ folder was also not written by me, nor any of the codes on the /sample_codes/ directory. They were also provided for educational purposes. You can find them and other resources at the [original project repo](https://github.com/damorim/compilers-cin)
- The same as described above applies for the files inside /2_type_checker/ **EXCEPT** the _README.md_, _test\_input.c_ and _GrammarCheckerVisitor.py_, which were written and/or modified by yours truly. As an additional note, the Grammar.g4 inside that folder serves the purpose of a "solved exercise" for the part 1 of this project. Since this was the "official" answer provided after the delivery date of part 1, I used it instead of the one I developed, for the sake of not having more headaches.
- The same also applies for the files inside /3_optimization/, **EXCEPT** the modifications made on the _GrammarCheckerVisitor.py_ and the generated _my\_outputXX.txt_. At this point I did not care enough to write a README. A formal specification was not provided for the project as well so I guess I wasn't the only one that did not care.
- The same also applies for the files inside /4_intermediary_representation/, except my outputs and modifications on the _GrammarCheckerVisitor.py_, etc  etc etc, you know the drill. At this point I did not care for anything else except managing my anxiety and not having to do this again in my life, ever. Oh 2020, what a year!

All the rest was made by me with love and despair. Sometimes one, sometimes another, and sometimes both. Sometimes [rage](https://64.media.tumblr.com/40d51c3c0828530a5c8266c100652a52/tumblr_p7uek3YwiY1xrqgt2o1_400.gif) took a part in the play as well.

Hope this helps someone, someday.
(But at the same time, I wish that no one ever has to go through this suffering.)
