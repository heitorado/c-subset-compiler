# C Subset Compiler
This is my repo for store and track progress on the college project for the Compilers course on the second semester of 2020. Due to the pandemics the semester is of extraordinary character and it was called "2020.3".

The project consists on building a compiler for a subset of the C language. ANTLR is being used for parser generation.

# Running
Instructions to run each part of the project are contained on their respective folders.

# Copyright, disclaimers, and other stuff
- I, obviously, did not develop the .jar package of the ANTLR software provided in this repo. It was a copy provided for developing this project. Refer to the [official ANTLR website](https://www.antlr.org/) for the latest version and more info, etc.
- The makefile inside the /1_antl_grammar/ folder was also not written by me, nor any of the codes on the /sample_codes/ directory. They were also provided for educational purposes. You can find them an other resources at the [original project repo](https://github.com/damorim/compilers-cin)
- The same as described above applies for the files inside /2_type_checker/ **EXCEPT** the _README.md_, _test\_input.c_ and _GrammarCheckerVisitor.py_, which were written by yours truly. As an additional note, the Grammar.g4 inside that folder serves the purpose of a "solved exercise" for the part 1 of this project. Since this was the "official" answer provided after the delivery date of part 1, I used it instead of the one I developed, for the sake of not having more headaches.

All the rest was made by me with love and despair. Sometimes one, sometimes another, and sometimes both.

Hope this helps someone, someday.
